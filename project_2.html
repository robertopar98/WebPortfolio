            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>This project is focus on solving a Binary Classification problem: identifying whether a mushrooms is poisonous
                or edible based on its characteristics. The dataset used in this project is provided by the Kaggle Playground
                Series (Season 4, Episode 8) and contains variety of categorical features (color, shape, types) and numerical
                features (height, width or diameter).
            </p>
            <p> The primary goal of the project is to accurately classify mushrooms using an optimized model that generalizes well, 
                avoiding overfitting and ensuring a balance between prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.
            </p>    
            <p> Through this project, I demonstrate my ability to apply Machine Learning techniques, such as Data Preprocessing,
                Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), hyperparameter tuning, model selection and evaluation, all while leveraring tools
                like XGBoost or LightGBM for an efficient classification.

        <section id="data-overview">
            <h2>Data Overview</h2>
            <p>The dataset used for training in this project comes from a large collection of over 3 million mushroom records, 
                containing 22 features and a target variable (class) that indicates whether a mushroom is poisonous or edible. 
                The features include a mix of categorical and numerical data, which describe various physical characteristics of 
                mushrooms such as cap shape, gill color, stem height, and more. </p>

            <p>The dataset includes:</p>
            
            <li>Numerical Features: These include cap-diameter, stem-height, and stem-width, which provide measurements of 
                different parts of the mushrooms.</li>
                    
            <li>Categorical Features: There are 18 categorical features such as cap-shape, cap-surface, gill-color, and 
                spore-print-color, which describe the visual characteristics of mushrooms.</li>
            
            <h3>Missing Values</h3>
            <p>Several features in the dataset have a substantial amount of missing data, with over 60% of values missing. To assess
                 whether these features are essential for the model, we performed a Cramér's V analysis and Chi-square contingency test.
                  These tests help determine the association between each feature and the target variable. Features with weak 
                  associations and significant missing values may be candidates for removal, while those with strong associations might
                   be filled using appropriate imputation methods. This ensures that we do not discard features that could provide 
                   valuable insights despite their missing data.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Class Distribution</h3>
            <p>The dataset contains a slightly imbalanced distribution between edible and poisonous mushrooms. Approximately 1.7 million
                 records are poisonous, and 1.4 million are edible. Although the class imbalance exists, it is not extreme enough to 
                 require specialized techniques like oversampling or undersampling. Therefore, we proceed without applying 
                 class-balancing methods, considering the classifier's robustness should suffice for this level of imbalance.

        <section id="EDA">
            <h2>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h2>
            <p>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical step in understanding the dataset's characteristics and identifying patterns
                or anomalies. In this section, we perform a comprehensive EDA on the poisonous mushrooms dataset to uncover insights and 
                inform the model development process.</p>
            
            <h3>Univariate Analysis</h3>
            <p>We began our univariate analysis by examining the distribution of numerical features and detecting outliers. Histograms and 
                boxplots were utilized to visualize the distribution of these features. Outlier detection was performed using the quartile 
                method, specifically focusing on the 5% and 95% percentiles. For instance, the 'cap-diameter' feature exhibited around 13,000 
                outliers, which prompted us to carefully consider their impact on model performance. Given that outliers can significantly 
                affect the results, we explored transformations such as Box-Cox to normalize the feature distributions and mitigate the influence 
                of extreme values. This step is crucial as it ensures the robustness of our models by reducing the distortion caused by outliers.

            <h3>Bivariate Analysis</h3>
            <p>We performed a detailed examination of categorical features with respect to the target variable ('class'). This included generating
                count plots to visualize the distribution of each categorical feature for the different classes—'edible' and 'poisonous'. 
                Additionally, a stacked bar plot was created to illustrate the distribution of unique values within each categorical feature based
                on the class. These visualizations help in understanding the relationship between categorical variables and the target variable, 
                providing insights into which features are most informative for classification.

            <h3>Correlation Analysis</h3>
            <p>Correlation Matrix</p>
            <p>A correlation matrix was constructed to analyze the relationships between numerical features. This matrix helps in identifying any 
                strong correlations among features, which can be useful for feature selection and engineering.

            <p>Chi-Square Test of Independence</p>
            <p>To evaluate the strength of the association between categorical features and the target variable, we conducted the Chi-Square test of 
                independence. This statistical test assesses whether there is a significant association between categorical variables.
